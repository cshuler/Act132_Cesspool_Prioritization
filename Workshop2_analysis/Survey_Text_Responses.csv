Importantly and specifically, we really don't know how long coral reefs need to be exposed to wastewater pollution to experience negative impacts.

Sewage from cesspools close to the shoreline has insufficient time to be treated by natural processes.,"Distance to municipal wells is definitely important.  But, This over-simplifies the aquifer structure.  Drinking water tends to be pumped from much deeper (preferably confined) to avoid the top part of the aquifer that can be contaminated by a variety of sources. However, as the Red Hill situation shows, contamination from the surface can impact drinking wells.  A prioritized list of wells from each water provider (County & private suppliers of municipal water; those who best understand the hydrology, chemistry, and potential contamination sources) would make this factor much more applicable.",Need to prioritize public resources over private.  This would prioritize wealthy land owners that can afford to have a well (vs. the poorer that rely on catchment systems).  Not all wells are in use.,I'm not convinced the models are accurate enough to accurately make this prediction.  Distance from municipal well will capture much of the cesspools impacting the wells.Sur,There is no geologic setting where a cesspool is an appropriate solution.  There is simply too little known about the vadose zone and aquifer processing of sewage pollutants to say whether one geologic type is better than another.,"I agree that the dilution of sewage in an aquifer is important, but the method here is wrong.  The flux of groundwater at the shoreline integrates all the recharge in the aquifer's watershed.  As a result, the groundwater flux decreases with distance inland (less area for recharge moving inland from the shoreline), which is the opposite of the orthographic rainfall trends that are plotted.  That is, low rainfall at the shoreline doesn't mean less dilution than mauka regions- Instead there is more dilution because of all the mauka rain that contributed to the groundwater discharge at the shoreline.  Suggestion: Instead of doing this for individual cesspools, work at the aquifer scale.  The USGS has several reports where they calculated the recharge of each aquifer, including accounting for changes in precipitation due to climate change.  You could take the recharge from those reports and divide it by the length of shoreline to normalize the recharge of each aquifer.  Shorelines with high recharge per m of shoreline would rank lower than those with a low recharge per m of shoreline.  Plus, this method integrates rainfall all the way to the inland boundary of the ground-watershed.",Definitely important.  Sewage from cesspools close to the streams or wetlands has insufficient time to be treated by natural processes.,"Definitely important.  But at the same time, I hesitate to give it a 5 because some of the other factors are more important.","Definitely important.  I'd like to see the results of the ""Priority Score"" instead of the depth to GW in Fig 12.  I worry this may not be accurate near streams?  That is, many streams seem to be gaining groundwater, but the water table seems to be much lower.  Better hydrologic information connecting streams to groundwater and vice versa would be very useful. ","Definitely important.  Cesspools impacted by SLR means that they are both close to the shoreline and close to the water table, two factors that I ranked the highest in importance.  Sewage from these homes receives minimal treatment before discharging into the ocean.   However, I am concerned that there is too much overlap among these three factors.  ","I have two serious concerns about the coral and fish factors (#11, 12).  First, the skill of the groundwater flow path model is not high enough to make accurate predictions of where groundwater from an individual cesspool will discharge at the shoreline.  That level of hydrologic detail is not captured in the models.  For example, in West Maui, the groundwater flow paths are normal to the shoreline.  But, hydrologic studies at the Lahaina WWTP (~500 m inland) found that the groundwater flowed to the south to shoreline springs that emerge more than 500 m south along the shoreline.  My dye tracer work has shown similar results, with dye rarely traveling normal to the shoreline.  Also, a substantial volume of groundwater discharges offshore in deep water away from corals and where the fish biomass surveys were completed, not at the shoreline.  The GW flow paths model is not able to account for either of these processes, so should not be used for cesspool prioritization.   Suggestion: Integrate at a larger spatial scale instead of trying to pinpoint individual cesspools.  Like I mentioned earlier, working at the aquifer scale could be better.  This isn't a perfect solution, either, but at least it's grounded in robust analysis of the groundwater system and doesn't provide over-confidence in what is happening at an individual cesspool.  It would be nice to be able to go to a smaller-scale, like the ahupua'a, but I don't think the groundwater hydrology and these land divisions necessarily match up.
The other concern is on placing a value on corals around the state.  It seems to me that outside of river influence and sand patches, corals should thrive everywhere around Hawai'i. So, nearly everywhere should be ranked high for coral cover importance.  Suggestion: What about doing a factor that is distance from recognized cultural, biological, and geologic resources (e.g. marine life conservation districts, state parks, national parks,...). ","This is just copy and paste response from Q11....  I have two serious concerns about the coral and fish factors (#11, 12).

","With 1.4 million people living in Hawai'i, and 10 million tourists that are here specifically to visit our beaches, the number of toursists visiting our coastline far exceeds the number of locals.  We shouldn't be replacing cesspools based on tourist numbers; We need to replace cesspools based on the needs of the people that live here.","Lifeguards are county-funded, so the number of lifeguarded beaches is a funding and political issue and does not accurately reflect the visitation or cultural or biological importance of specific beaches.  Especially since the beaches where locals go often are not those with lifeguards, so may reflect where tourists are encouraged to go instead of where persistent, cronic exposure to locals is occurring.","While I agree this is an issue, wave energy is not the way to quantify it.  The bigger problem are shorelines with a long residence time, such as those with abundant tidepools.  A gentle slope and rocky shorleine likely has a worse impact, by allowing water to pond and increasing the residence time.  These calm water are also very attractive for families and kapuna, those at greatest risk of sickness from swimming in water polluted with sewage.  Shoreline characterization studies that allow these regions to be identified would be useful, but they only exist in a few locations.  Unfortunately, a statewide dataset is not available yet.  Wave data for West Hawai'i and other locations is notoriously bad.  And, because the wave environment is seasonal further complicates the use of this data.

Additional Comments about the entire report: I really like the work that you are doing here, and you are raising very important questions.  And, I think the data gaps you are identifying will be important for a lot of future management of coastal and groundwater resources. Mahalo for including me!"
