Drinking water tends to be pumped from much deeper (preferably confined) to avoid the top part of the aquifer that can be contaminated by a variety of sources. However, as the Red Hill situation shows, contamination from the surface can impact drinking wells.  A prioritized list of wells from each water provider (County & private suppliers of municipal water; those who best understand the hydrology, chemistry, and potential contamination sources) would make this factor much more applicable."

The flux of groundwater at the shoreline integrates all the recharge in the aquifer's watershed.  As a result, the groundwater flux decreases with distance inland (less area for recharge moving inland from the shoreline), which is the opposite of the orthographic rainfall trends that are plotted.  That is, low rainfall at the shoreline doesn't mean less dilution than mauka regions- Instead there is more dilution because of all the mauka rain that contributed to the groundwater discharge at the shoreline.  Suggestion: Instead of doing this for individual cesspools, work at the aquifer scale.  The USGS has several reports where they calculated the recharge of each aquifer, including accounting for changes in precipitation due to climate change.  You could take the recharge from those reports and divide it by the length of shoreline to normalize the recharge of each aquifer.  Shorelines with high recharge per m of shoreline would rank lower than those with a low recharge per m of shoreline.  Plus, this method integrates rainfall all the way to the inland boundary of the ground-watershed.</td>\n",

       "12  I agree that the dilution of sewage in an aquifer is important, but the method here is wrong.  The flux of groundwater at the shoreline integrates all the recharge in the aquifer's watershed.  As a result, the groundwater flux decreases with distance inland (less area for recharge moving inland from the shoreline), which is the opposite of the orthographic rainfall trends that are plotted.  That is, low rainfall at the shoreline doesn't mean less dilution than mauka regions- Instead there is more dilution because of all the mauka rain that contributed to the groundwater discharge at the shoreline.  Suggestion: Instead of doing this for individual cesspools, work at the aquifer scale.  The USGS has several reports where they calculated the recharge of each aquifer, including accounting for changes in precipitation due to climate change.  You could take the recharge from those reports and divide it by the length of shoreline to normalize the recharge of each aquifer.  Shorelines with high recharge per m of shoreline would rank lower than those with a low recharge per m of shoreline.  Plus, this method integrates rainfall all the way to the inland boundary of the ground-watershed."

First, the skill of the groundwater flow path model is not high enough to make accurate predictions of where groundwater from an individual cesspool will discharge at the shoreline.  That level of hydrologic detail is not captured in the models.  For example, in West Maui, the groundwater flow paths are normal to the shoreline.  But, hydrologic studies at the Lahaina WWTP (~500 m inland) found that the groundwater flowed to the south to shoreline springs that emerge more than 500 m south along the shoreline.  My dye tracer work has shown similar results, with dye rarely traveling normal to the shoreline.  Also, a substantial volume of groundwater discharges offshore in deep water away from corals and where the fish biomass surveys were completed, not at the shoreline.  The GW flow paths model is not able to account for either of these processes, so should not be used for cesspool prioritization.   Suggestion: Integrate at a larger spatial scale instead of trying to pinpoint individual cesspools.  Like I mentioned earlier, working at the aquifer scale could be better.  This isn't a perfect solution, either, but at least it's grounded in robust analysis of the groundwater system and doesn't provide over-confidence in what is happening at an individual cesspool.  It would be nice to be able to go to a smaller-scale, like the ahupua'a, but I don't think the groundwater hydrology and these land divisions necessarily match up.\\nThe other concern is on placing a value on corals around the state.  It seems to me that outside of river influence and sand patches, corals should thrive everywhere around Hawai'i. So, nearly everywhere should be ranked high for coral cover importance.  Suggestion: What about doing a factor that is distance from recognized cultural, biological, and geologic resources (e.g. marine life conservation districts, state parks, national parks,...).</td>\n",

       "0   I agree on prioritizing areas with more coral cover and recovery potential, but I chose to give it a lower weight due to the fact that there may be some other factors affecting the survival and recovery of corals. Is it known that these areas are being impacted by sewage pollution or are they able to be given a higher score, because they aren't currently being impacted as much as other areas due to things like ocean circulation and residence time?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "12  I have two serious concerns about the coral and fish factors (#11, 12).  First, the skill of the groundwater flow path model is not high enough to make accurate predictions of where groundwater from an individual cesspool will discharge at the shoreline.  That level of hydrologic detail is not captured in the models.  For example, in West Maui, the groundwater flow paths are normal to the shoreline.  But, hydrologic studies at the Lahaina WWTP (~500 m inland) found that the groundwater flowed to the south to shoreline springs that emerge more than 500 m south along the shoreline.  My dye tracer work has shown similar results, with dye rarely traveling normal to the shoreline.  Also, a substantial volume of groundwater discharges offshore in deep water away from corals and where the fish biomass surveys were completed, not at the shoreline.  The GW flow paths model is not able to account for either of these processes, so should not be used for cesspool prioritization.   Suggestion: Integrate at a larger spatial scale instead of trying to pinpoint individual cesspools.  Like I mentioned earlier, working at the aquifer scale could be better.  This isn't a perfect solution, either, but at least it's grounded in robust analysis of the groundwater system and doesn't provide over-confidence in what is happening at an individual cesspool.  It would be nice to be able to go to a smaller-scale, like the ahupua'a, but I don't think the groundwater hydrology and these land divisions necessarily match up.\\nThe other concern is on placing a value on corals around the state.  It seems to me that outside of river influence and sand patches, corals should thrive everywhere around Hawai'i. So, nearly everywhere should be ranked high for coral cover importance.  Suggestion: What about doing a factor that is distance from recognized cultural, biological, and geologic resources (e.g. marine life conservation districts, state parks, national parks,...). "

Suggestion: What about doing a factor that is distance from recognized cultural, biological, and geologic resources (e.g. marine life conservation districts, state parks, national parks,...).</td>\n",

       "12  This is just copy and paste response from Q11....  I have two serious concerns about the coral and fish factors (#11, 12).  First, the skill of the groundwater flow path model is not high enough to make accurate predictions of where groundwater from an individual cesspool will discharge at the shoreline.  That level of hydrologic detail is not captured in the models.  For example, in West Maui, the groundwater flow paths are normal to the shoreline.  But, hydrologic studies at the Lahaina WWTP (~500 m inland) found that the groundwater flowed to the south to shoreline springs that emerge more than 500 m south along the shoreline.  My dye tracer work has shown similar results, with dye rarely traveling normal to the shoreline.  Also, a substantial volume of groundwater discharges offshore in deep water away from corals and where the fish biomass surveys were completed, not at the shoreline.  The GW flow paths model is not able to account for either of these processes, so should not be used for cesspool prioritization.   Suggestion: Integrate at a larger spatial scale instead of trying to pinpoint individual cesspools.  Like I mentioned earlier, working at the aquifer scale could be better.  This isn't a perfect solution, either, but at least it's grounded in robust analysis of the groundwater system and doesn't provide over-confidence in what is happening at an individual cesspool.  It would be nice to be able to go to a smaller-scale, like the ahupua'a, but I don't think the groundwater hydrology and these land divisions necessarily match up.\\nThe other concern is on placing a value on corals around the state.  It seems to me that outside of river influence and sand patches, corals should thrive everywhere around Hawai'i. So, nearly everywhere should be ranked high for coral cover importance.  Suggestion: What about doing a factor that is distance from recognized cultural, biological, and geologic resources (e.g. marine life conservation districts, state parks, national parks,...). "

These calm water are also very attractive for families and kapuna, those at greatest risk of sickness from swimming in water polluted with sewage.  Shoreline characterization studies that allow these regions to be identified would be useful, but they only exist in a few locations.  Unfortunately, a statewide dataset is not available yet.  Wave data for West Hawai'i and other locations is notoriously bad.

Note that i produced the wave metric used here, for what it's worth. \\n\\nImportantly and specifically, we really don't know how long coral reefs need to be exposed to wastewater pollution to experience negative impacts. If the residence time is long for just a few months a year such as it is on the North Shore of Oahu, that could be more than enough time to impact reefs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "12  While I agree this is an issue, wave energy is not the way to quantify it.  The bigger problem are shorelines with a long residence time, such as those with abundant tidepools.  A gentle slope and rocky shorleine likely has a worse impact, by allowing water to pond and increasing the residence time.  These calm water are also very attractive for families and kapuna, those at greatest risk of sickness from swimming in water polluted with sewage.  Shoreline characterization studies that allow these regions to be identified would be useful, but they only exist in a few locations.  Unfortunately, a statewide dataset is not available yet.  Wave data for West Hawai'i and other locations is notoriously bad.  And, because the wave environment is seasonal further complicates the use of this data.\\n\\nAdditional Comments about the entire report: I really like the work that you are doing here, and you are raising very important questions.  And, I think the data gaps you are identifying will be important for a lot of future management of coastal and groundwater resources. Mahalo for including me!"
