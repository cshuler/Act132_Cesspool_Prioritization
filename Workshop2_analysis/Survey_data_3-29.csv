(Q1) Distance to Coastline: Defined as the geographic distance (not necessarily the groundwater flow path distance) between each cesspool and the nearest point on the HI State Coastline Shapefile. For details see pg. 27 of the full report.,(Q2) Distance to Municipal Drinking Water Wells: The distance between each cesspool and the geographically nearest municipal drinking water well as listed in and defined by the CWRM well permitting database. For details see pg. 28 of the full report.,(Q3) Distance to Private/Domestic Drinking Water Wells: The distance between each cesspool and the geographically nearest private/domestic drinking water well as listed in and defined by the CWRM well permitting database. For details see pg. 28 of the full report.,(Q4) Drinking Water Well Capture Zones: Well capture zones were defined by HI Dept. of Health using groundwater modeling and represent the area from which water will enter a well given travel times of 2-years (Zone B) and a 10-years (Zone C). Cesspools are defined as either inside or outside of Zone C and or Zone B. More information is available from the DoH SWAP program https://health.hawaii.gov/sdwb/swap/ For details see pg. 30 of the full report.,(Q5) Soil/Geological Data: This factor synthesizes a combination of seven (7) individual soil parameters defined by the NRCS soil survey into a single numeric score.  Please see pg. 32 of the full report for information on how the soil score was calculated.  ,(Q6) Average Annual Rainfall: Higher rainfall provides enhanced subsurface dilution to cesspool effluent. Gridded rainfall amounts were assigned to each cesspool from the Hawaii Rainfall Atlas. For details see pg. 36 of the full report.,(Q7) Distance to Streams or Wetlands: Defined as the distance between each cesspool and the nearest point on any stream or wetland body as shown on the National Hydraulic Dataset Streams and Wetlands Shapefiles. For details see pg. 38 of the full report.,"(Q8) Cesspool Density: Calculated through a point-wise density calculation using ArcMap's ""point density"" tool. Density units are number of cesspools per acre. For details see pg. 39 of the full report.",(Q9) Water Table Elevation (Depth to Groundwater): The depth to the groundwater table was calculated by subtracting the water table elevation calculated by DoH's statewide groundwater models from the land surface elevations as provided by LiDAR DEMs. For details see pg. 41 of the full report.,(Q10)  Risk of Impact from Sea Level-Rise: Sea Level Rise (SLR) scenarios for multiple future time-steps were collected from the Hawai?i Sea Level Rise Viewer. Cesspools were considered to be affected if located inside of SLR flood zones or are affected by rising water tables by calculating the changes in water table depth through the groundwater model results. For details see pg. 43 of the full report.,(Q11)  Coral Cover and Recovery Potential: The robustness and ecological value of the coral ecosystem at the point along the coastline where each cesspool's groundwater flow path discharges. For details see pg. 45 of the full report.,(Q12)  Resource Fish Biomass and Recovery Potential: The robustness and value of the nearshore fishery at the point along the coastline where each cesspool's groundwater flow path discharges. For details see pg. 48 of the full report.,(Q13)  Coastline Visitation (User-days): The rate of human visitation to view and photograph coastal resources at the point along the coastline where each cesspool's groundwater flow path discharges. For details see pg. 51 of the full report.,"(Q14) Lifeguarded Swimming Beaches: Lifeguard towers were mapped, and if a cesspool's effluent discharges to a point within 1 km of a life-guarded beach, it is designated as a cesspool that affects a swimming beach. For details see pg. 53 of the full report.",(Q15) Ocean Circulation and Residence Time Proxy: Wave power provided by the Hawaii Ocean Tipping Points Project was used as a proxy of coastal water residence time at the point along the coastline where each cesspool's groundwater flow path discharges. For details see pg. 54 of the full report.
